Welcome to our collection, where we explore the complex relationship that exists in Texas between sociodemographic characteristics and the accessibility of Residential Cooling Infrastructure (RCI). This repository contains a carefully chosen selection of materials essential to our research:

- Processed Zillow Property Data: Zillow's copious property transaction records were used to carefully compile this dataset. In order to guarantee that the data offers a solid basis for comprehending housing dynamics in heat-threatened areas, we have cleaned, compiled, and anonymized it.

- Analysis Code: These are the R or Python scripts, depending on which one you chose, that were used to analyze the data. The scripts include the preprocessing of data and exploratory data analysis. To make the code easier to read and duplicate, we've made sure it's well-structured and commented.

- Completely assembled datasets for models using logistic regression: This dataset, which forms the basis of our study, contains the variables and constructs that we obtained during our extensive data processing work. It allows us to delve deeply into the factors influencing RCI accessibility by acting as the direct input for our logistic regression models.

Our goal is to promote cooperation and openness in scholarly research. We invite you to investigate the information, repurpose the code, and participate in this important investigation into how sociodemographic differences affect the accessibility of vital cooling systems in the face of rising temperatures.
